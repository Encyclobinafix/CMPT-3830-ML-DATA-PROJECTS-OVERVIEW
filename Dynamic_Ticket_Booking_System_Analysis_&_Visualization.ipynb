        "# Objective:\n",
        "##The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a Dynamic Ticketing System that efficiently handles event ticket bookings, cancellations, and modifications while managing overbooked requests using a waitlist system. Your solution should show the implementation of data structures such as dynamic arrays, hash tables, and priority queues to achieve these functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Scenario:\n",
        "- Imagine a popular band, is performing at a 500-seat concert venue in Edmonton. The event is in high demand, and ticket booking is managed through a Dynamic Ticketing System to ensure fairness, efficiency, and priority-based handling of overbooking situations. Now develop a python program with following features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### A.Ticket Booking:\n",
        "- The program will show all 500 seats in a 20X25 grid at the beginning. Then a customer will be able to select a seat with priority and booking related information (such as name, mobile number, email address).\n",
        "- After booking, the program will assign a unique Ticket ID/Reference for each booking.\n",
        "- If no seats are available, your program will add the customer to a waitlist managed by a priority queue."
