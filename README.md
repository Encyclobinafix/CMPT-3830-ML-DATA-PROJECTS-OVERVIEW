# CMPT-3830-ML-DATA-PROJECTS-OVERVIEW
Desmonstrating full Machine Learning and Data Analysis skills using open-source datasets.

** This project replicates the methodology of a confidential industry project completed during my Work-Integrated Learning experience. All data shown here are open-source and not affiliated with the client organization.**

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and data analysis projects completed as part of my Machine Learning Analyst Program. Each notebook demonstrates end-to-end analytical workflows—data cleaning, exploratory analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation—using real-world datasets across different domains.
